## Diabetes Prediction
This project delves into the application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for thorough data analysis and employs various machine learning models for predictive modeling of diabetes. It spans multiple stages, starting from data exploration to comparing results. In this document, I aim to offer succinct insights into the tasks, their goals, and the outcomes achieved at each step.

DATA EXPLORATION: Upon gathering the dataset, an initial assessment disclosed that it consists of 101,766 entries and encompasses 50 feature columns, comprising 37 numerical and 13 categorical features. Several columns exhibited missing values, represented by the symbol '?'. The columns affected by missing values include race, weight, payer_code, medical_specialty, diag_1, diag_2, diag_3, max_glu_serum, and A1Cresult. The percentage distribution of missing values in each column is presented in Table.01.

Table. 01. Information of missing values in each column.
Name of the Column	Percentage of Missing Values
race	2.233555
weight	96.858479
payer_code	39.557416
medical_specialty	49.082208
diag_1	0.020636
diag_2	0.351787
diag_3	1.398306
max_glu_serum	94.746772
A1Cresult	83.277322

PREPROCESSING: Data processing involves several steps, depending on different factors. Such as,
1.	Handling Missing Values: To handle missing values effectively, a multi-step approach was employed.  
a.	Dropping Columns: Columns with over 40% missing values were dropped to maintain data integrity. At first, the dataset encompassed 101,766 entries and 50 columns, incorporating diverse patient information,biomedical data, and medication details. After processing 4 columns (weight, medical_specialty , max_glu_serum, A1Cresult ) got deducted.
b.	Filling in Numerical Missing Values: Missing values in numerical columns (diag_1, diag_2, diag_3) were imputed with the mean to preserve statistical accuracy because
c.	Filling in Categorical Missing Values: Missing values in categorical columns (race, payer_code) were imputed with the mode to retain the most common values.

2.	Handling Data Types: One-hot encoding is applied to categorical variables in the dataset, such as race, gender, etc. This process expands each categorical variable into binary columns, representing the presence or absence of each category. The use of pd.get_dummies with drop_first=True helps mitigate multicollinearity issues, enhancing the compatibility of categorical data with machine learning models.
3.	Normalization: Numerical features, including diagnostic codes and laboratory results, undergo normalization using the StandardScaler. This step ensures that numerical values are on a comparable scale, preventing certain features from dominating others during model training. The scaled features, stored in X_scaled, contribute to a more stable and efficient training process across various machine learning algorithms.

MODEL SELECTION 
In choosing machine learning models for diabetes prediction, the selection process was guided by the dataset's characteristics. Reasoning for selecting machine learning models:

1.	Logistic Regression: Chosen for its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in binary classification.
2.	Decision Tree: Selected for capturing complex relationships in diverse dataset features.
3.	Support Vector Machine (SVM): Opted for handling high-dimensional data and complex decision boundaries.
4.	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Included for simplicity and adaptability, crucial for local patterns.
5.	Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier chosen for efficiency in handling categorical features.

Ensemble methods leverage the strengths of multiple models, mitigating individual model weaknesses and improving overall predictive performance. Reasoning for selecting ensemble techniques:

1.	Random Forest: Selected for diversity and stability through multiple decision trees, mitigating overfitting.
2.	Gradient Boosting: Chosen for sequential refinement, focusing on misclassified instances for improved accuracy.
3.	XGBoost: Included for efficiency, scalability, and advanced regularization, suitable for large datasets and effective diabetes prediction.

TRAINING AND CROSS-VALIDATION
The training process involved utilizing 80% of the dataset, followed by rigorous evaluation through 5-fold cross-validation. This methodology facilitates a meticulous examination of each model's performance across distinct subsets of the data. The goal is to ensure a robust assessment of their predictive capabilities in the specific context of diabetes prediction, promoting confidence in the model's generalizability.

RESULTS: Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and F1 score were utilized to compare model performances. The following results were obtained:
 
Apart from Logistic Regression and Decision Tree, ensemble techniques such as, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoostâ€”demonstrates robust performance in diabetes prediction. In contrast, KNN displayed the lowest accuracy and F1 score, followed by SVM and Naive Bayes, is likely due to its sensitivity to local patterns, limiting its ability to capture broader relationships in the dataset.
